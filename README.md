# **Timed Quiz Game**
 
## **Project Description**

This web application was created to challenge web developers of their general coding knowledge. The quiz is timed to 60 seconds so challengers are to attempt to answer as many questions correctly within that time limit.   

## **How to Use the Project**

Start the quiz by clicking the "start" button. From there, answer as many questions as you can within the alloted time period. Correct answer will count towards your final score, but be careful! Wrong answers will take a few seconds off your timer each time. At the conclusion of the quiz you'll be prompted to enter your initials to record and save your scores. High scores will be logged and displayed on the "High Scores" page of the application. Good luck and have fun quizzing!
